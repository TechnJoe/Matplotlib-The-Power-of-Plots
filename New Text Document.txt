SUMMARY OF THE STUDY REPORT FOR PYMACEAUTICALS INC ANTI-CANCER RESEARCH

STUDY
Analyze animal study data, screening for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.
In the study, 249 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Tumor development was observed and measured.This script analyzes the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin) compare.

TUMOR VOLUME RESPONSE TO TREATMENT
Based on the final tumor volume of each mouse across the four regimens of interest, Ramicane had the least amount of metastatic spread compared to the others. It was followed closely by Capomulin

SURVIVAL RATE
In terms of survival, it seems like Ramicane would be the best overall drug due to the drug providing less tumor volume and less metastatic spread.

LIMITATIONS
The average, tumor volume increased as the weight increased.

CONCLUSION
Based on the low tumor volume count analysis after the intensive study of the laboratory research data provided, Ramicane should be the drug of choice for this treatment.
